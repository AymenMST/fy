            <p>Hey, you girl. Yes, it's you, the only girl's in my mind all day. I was so nervous, did not know what would happend if I told you these words. But finally, I decided to say them out. I don't know when it happend - the feeling of me with you. It's not like friendship , everytime I see your face, your smile, everytime I hear your voice, I get a strange feeling, my heart beats faster. Is that called "love"? I don't know, it's just like I want to be more than friend to you, not normal friend or close friend, a higher level of relationship, I want to be someone to shelte you, who can makes you smile, who can be the one that you can confide in when you're sad, who can be the one that you can share your happiness..., I don't know that I can have that chance or not, I just want to express my feeling to you, Don't know that I can be hurt, hmm, it's okay, right ? , Be brave.
                And finally, I just want to say that : "I love you, will you be my girlfriend, and be my wife in the future ? " . Pls answer me.:) Love you! ♥
